# PV-Doctor
Objective:
To preprocess the data and create a visualization using the preprocessed dataset.

Dataset:
You must download and extract the zip file. The zip file contains CSV files that have 5 days of PR and GHI data, organized into directories based on the start month and parameter (PR or GHI). PR (Performance Ratio) – This parameter is used to track the daily performance of the PV plant. A high value indicates that the plant is performing well and there are no issues. GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance) – This parameter tracks the total irradiation for a particular day. A high value indicates a sunny day.

Data preprocessing:
Generate a single CSV file containing all the data from both the PR and GHI folders. The new CSV file should contain 3 columns: Date, GHI, PR.
